-- D. Pricing and Ratings

-- 1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
SELECT pizza_name,
SUM(CASE
WHEN o.pizza_id=1 THEN 12
WHEN o.pizza_id=2 THEN 10
ELSE 0
END) total_sale
FROM customer_orders o
JOIN pizza_names n ON o.pizza_id=n.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizza_name, o.pizza_id
ORDER BY o.pizza_id;

-- 2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
-- ● Add cheese is $1 extra
DROP VIEW order_number;
CREATE VIEW order_number AS 
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER () row_num, order_id, customer_id, pizza_id, exclusions, extras, order_time

DROP VIEW additional;

WHEN p.pizza_id= 2 THEN 10+extra_toppings

GROUP BY pizza_name;

-- 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset 
-- - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.


-- 4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
-- ● customer_id
-- ● order_id
-- ● runner_id
-- ● rating
-- ● order_time
-- ● pickup_time
-- ● time between order and pickup
-- ● delivery duration
-- ● average speed
-- ● total number of pizzas

-- 6. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - 
-- how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
