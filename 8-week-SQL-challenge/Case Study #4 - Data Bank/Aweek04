-- A. Customer Nodes Exploration

-- 1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) unique_nodes
FROM customer_nodes;

-- 2. What is the number of nodes per region?
SELECT region_id, COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) unique_nodes
FROM customer_nodes
GROUP BY region_id;

-- 3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
SELECT region_id, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) unique_cust
FROM customer_nodes
GROUP BY region_id;

-- 4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
SELECT ROUND(AVG(end_date-start_date)) avg_days_to_rellocation
FROM customer_nodes;
-- According to the calculation, it takes 416,373 days in average to rellocate to a different node. That does not make any sense to us, 
-- so we want to check if there are any errors in the dates.

SELECT customer_id, end_date, start_date, end_date-start_date diff
FROM customer_nodes
GROUP BY customer_id, end_date, start_date
ORDER BY customer_id, end_date DESC;
-- As suspected, there is an error in the data: some end dates are corrupted and have '9999-12-31' as a value. This need to be corrected before moving forward. 
-- In order to calculate the end dates, we will use the average of days to rellocation for each customer and add it to the last start date.

WITH diff AS (
	SELECT customer_id, ROUND(AVG(end_date-start_date)) diff
	FROM customer_nodes
	WHERE end_date!='9999-12-31'
	GROUP BY customer_id
	ORDER BY customer_id),

new_end_date AS (
SELECT c.customer_id, c.start_date+d.diff::int new_end_date
	FROM customer_nodes c
	JOIN diff d ON c.customer_id=d.customer_id
	WHERE c.end_date='9999-12-31'
	ORDER BY customer_id)
	
 -- we update the customer_nodes table with the new end_dates
UPDATE customer_nodes
SET end_date=new_end_date
FROM new_end_date
WHERE customer_nodes.customer_id=new_end_date.customer_id
AND end_date='9999-12-31';

-- Now we can calculate how many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node
SELECT ROUND(AVG(end_date-start_date)) avg_days_to_rellocation
FROM customer_nodes;

-- 5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?
WITH diff AS (
	SELECT region_id, end_date-start_date diff
	FROM customer_nodes
	ORDER BY region_id)
	
SELECT region_id,
PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY diff.diff) median,
PERCENTILE_DISC(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY diff.diff) percentile_80,
PERCENTILE_DISC(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY diff.diff) percentile_95
FROM diff
GROUP BY region_id;
