-- C. Data Allocation Challenge
-- To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:
-- Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month
-- Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
-- Option 3: data is updated real-time

-- For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data
-- will need to be provisioned for each option:
-- a. running customer balance column that includes the impact of each transaction
-- b. customer balance at the end of each month
-- c. minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer
--Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required for each option on a monthly basis?

-- In order to solve this part of the project, we need to understand how is data storage calculated. According to the case study introduction, 
-- "customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts." 

-- We're now going to answer each part of the challenge.
-- a. running customer balance column that includes the impact of each transaction
-- This is not too clear for me, I do not understand what is meant with "that includes the **impact** of each transaction". Therefore, I will only create a running total column.
