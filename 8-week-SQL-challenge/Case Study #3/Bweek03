-- B. Data Analysis Questions
-- 1.	How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
DROP VIEW cust;
CREATE VIEW cust AS
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) cust
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id=p.plan_id
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(price) > 0.00;

SELECT COUNT(cust) total_customers
FROM cust;
-- This only takes into account customers that didn't churn after the trial and have made at least one payment.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) all_cust
FROM subscriptions;
-- This takes into account all customers, even if they churned after trial

-- 2.	What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
WITH yr_mnth AS (
	SELECT TO_CHAR(start_date, 'YYYY-MM') yr_mnth
	FROM subscriptions s
	WHERE plan_id=0)

SELECT yr_mnth, COUNT(yr_mnth) trials_per_month
FROM yr_mnth
GROUP BY yr_mnth
ORDER BY yr_mnth;

-- 3.	What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
SELECT plan_name, COUNT(s.plan_id) event_count
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id=p.plan_id
WHERE EXTRACT (YEAR FROM start_date) > 2020
GROUP BY plan_name, s.plan_id
ORDER BY s.plan_id;

-- 4.	What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
WITH churn AS (
SELECT s.customer_id, 
SUM(CASE 
WHEN plan_id=4 THEN 1
ELSE 0
END) churn,
COUNT(s.customer_id) OVER () total_customer_count
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN cust c ON s.customer_id=c.customer_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id)

SELECT total_customer_count, SUM(churn) churned_customers,
ROUND(SUM(churn)*100/total_customer_count, 1) churn_pct
FROM churn
GROUP BY total_customer_count;
-- This is if we only consider as customers those who have made some sort of payment.

WITH all_cust AS (
	SELECT customer_id, 
	SUM(CASE 
	WHEN plan_id=4 THEN 1
	ELSE 0
	END) churn,
	COUNT(customer_id) OVER () total_customer_count
	FROM subscriptions 
	GROUP BY customer_id
	ORDER BY customer_id)
	
SELECT total_customer_count, SUM(churn) churned_customers,
ROUND(SUM(churn)*100/total_customer_count, 1) churn_pct
FROM all_cust
GROUP BY total_customer_count;
-- This is if we consider all customers, regardeless of whether they have made a payment or not.



-- 5.	How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
WITH trial_churn AS (
	SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) cust
	FROM subscriptions s
	JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id=p.plan_id
	GROUP BY customer_id
	HAVING SUM(price) = 0.00
	ORDER BY customer_id)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id), SUM(cust) churned_after_trial, ROUND(SUM(cust)*100/COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id)) churned_after_trial_perc
FROM subscriptions s
LEFT JOIN trial_churn t ON s.customer_id=t.customer_id;


-- 6.	What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
WITH trial_plan AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT customer_id,
	CASE
	WHEN SUM(price) > 0.00 THEN 1
	ELSE 0
	END plan_after_trial
	FROM subscriptions s
	JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id=p.plan_id
	GROUP BY customer_id
	ORDER BY customer_id)

SELECT SUM(plan_after_trial) cust_w_plans, SUM(plan_after_trial)*100/COUNT(customer_id) plan_perc
FROM trial_plan;

--
-- Using cust view created in question 1
WITH trial_plan AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT s.customer_id, cust
	FROM subscriptions s
	LEFT JOIN cust c ON s.customer_id=c.customer_id
	ORDER BY s.customer_id)

SELECT SUM(cust) cust_w_plans, ROUND(SUM(cust)*100/COUNT(customer_id),2) plan_perc
FROM trial_plan;


-- 7.	What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
WITH last_record AS (
	SELECT customer_id, MAX(start_date) last_date
	FROM subscriptions s
	WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31'
	GROUP BY customer_id
	ORDER BY MAX(start_date)),

	SELECT plan_id, COUNT(plan_id) cnt_2020
	FROM last_record l
	LEFT JOIN subscriptions s ON s.customer_id=l.customer_id
	WHERE start_date=last_date
	GROUP BY plan_id
	ORDER BY plan_id)

SELECT plan_name, cnt_2020, ROUND(cnt_2020*100/SUM(cnt_2020) OVER (), 2) perc_2020
FROM last_active_plan l
JOIN plans p ON l.plan_id=p.plan_id;


-- 8.	How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
SELECT COUNT(*) annual_plan_2020
FROM subscriptions s
WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31'
AND plan_id=3;


-- 9.	How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
CREATE VIEW annual_plan AS
SELECT customer_id, plan_id, start_date annual_start_date
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id=3;

CREATE VIEW start_date AS
SELECT customer_id, plan_id, start_date
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id=0;

SELECT ROUND(AVG(annual_start_date-start_date)) diff
FROM start_date s
JOIN annual_plan a ON s.customer_id=a.customer_id;


-- 10.	Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
WITH diff AS (
SELECT annual_start_date-start_date diff
FROM start_date s
JOIN annual_plan a ON s.customer_id=a.customer_id),

start_day AS (
SELECT generate_series(1, (SELECT MAX(diff) FROM diff),
					 30) start_day),

intervals AS (
SELECT start_day, start_day+29 end_day
FROM start_day)

SELECT start_day, end_day,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM diff WHERE diff BETWEEN start_day AND end_day)
FROM intervals;

-- this script creates the 30-days date intervals, but I won't use it for this solution. Keeping it for posterity.
-- SELECT intervals::date start_date, LEAD(intervals::date) OVER ()-1 end_date
-- FROM generate_series((SELECT MIN(start_date) FROM start_date), 
--					 (SELECT MAX(annual_start_date) FROM annual_plan),
--					 '30 days') intervals;

-- 11.	How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
